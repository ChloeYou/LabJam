-- For lab managers:
--     We take lab manager id when they login
--     We show all projects in their lab, lab they are in, their PI, etc.
--     Show tables of all labs, all lab members, all lab managers, all researchers, all pi's.
--     When they click on a lab, we enter lab profile panel.
--     This is where we display all lab specific info (pi, researchers, projects, etc.)
--     Clicking on a project will take user to the project info panel described in the collaborator sql file.

--     All queries from researcher.sql are available to lab manager too
